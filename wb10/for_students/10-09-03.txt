Explain what your shader does and how it works.


I added light to my checkerboard texture from the camera's line of sight,
and I replaced the black and white colors of the checkerboard 
with a red and blue animation and an added image. 
Three sliders have been added to control checks, 
radius, and segs. Also, the sphere will go around and cross the square.
